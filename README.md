# Design Patterns - Adapter

This repository showcases an implementation of the Adapter design pattern in C#. The code demonstrates how to enable two incompatible interfaces to work together by creating an adapter that translates the interface of one class into another expected by the client. This pattern helps achieve flexibility by allowing objects with incompatible interfaces to collaborate.

## Introduction
The Adapter design pattern is a structural pattern that allows objects with incompatible interfaces to work together. It acts as a bridge between the client code and the adaptee, enabling the client to interact with the adaptee as if it implements the expected interface. This pattern is particularly useful when integrating legacy code or third-party libraries.

## Implementation Overview
This repository provides a C# implementation of the Adapter design pattern. Key components of the code include:

- **ITarget Interface**: Defines the interface that the client expects to work with.
- **Adaptee Class**: Contains a method (`SpecificRequest()`) that does not match the `ITarget` interface but needs to be adapted.
- **Adapter Class**: Implements the `ITarget` interface and translates calls to the `Adaptee`'s method.
- **Program Class**: Demonstrates how to use the `Adapter` class to allow client code to call the `Adaptee`'s method seamlessly.

## Installation
To get started with this project, clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/MansourJouya/DesignPattern-Adapter.git
```

Navigate into the project directory:

```bash
cd DesignPattern-Adapter
```

Open the solution in Visual Studio or your preferred C# development environment to explore the implementation.

## Usage
1. Open the solution file (.sln) in your C# development environment.
2. Run the `Program` class to see the Adapter pattern in action.
3. Modify the `Adaptee` class or the `Main()` method to customize the demonstration or adapt other methods.
